# Experiment 0

- `experiment01.py` includes basic embedding generation with sentence_transformer
- `experiment02.py` extend the embedding process to build a naive python list vector db and perform queries on [10, 100, 1000, 10000] sentences
- `experiment03.py` uses the chromadb to query the same [10, 100, 1000, 10000] sentences
- `main.py` include full code to compare performance between chromadb and naive python list
- `chroma_metadata.py` include using metadata in collection to filter based on condition
